- The names are clearly (e.g., `problem1.py`, `problem2.py`, `problem3.py`)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [https://github.com/vinhky123/SAP-Technical-Assignment]`
2. Foward to the directory: `cd SAP-Technical-Assignment`
3. Run each solution: `python problem1.py`
4. Input structure and format are clearly describe in the code

Thank you for your time and consideration.
