Dear SAP Student Talent Engagement and Attraction Team.

Thank you for your time reviewing my solutions for the technical assessment.

## Repository Structure

- Each file corresponds to one problem in the assessment.
- The names are clearly (e.g., `problem1.py`, `problem2.py`, `problem3.py`)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/vinhky123/SAP-Technical-Assessment`
2. Foward to the directory: `cd SAP-Technical-Assessment`
3. Run each solution: `python problem1.py`
4. Input structure and format are clearly describe in the code

Thank you for your time and consideration.
